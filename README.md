For this exercise, you'll be asked to build a simple payment plan calculator. Your goal is to write functional code so you can address the following business need:

Given an expected annual salary (input),  and an expected tuition amount (input) determine the monthly income share (output), and number of payments (output) so that:

- The total sum of all payments equals 1.2 times the tuition amount
- The monthly income share does not exceed 8%
- The number of payments is at least 36

Calculate the implied interest rate of the resulting payment plan (output)
